# What is Blindpad?

Blindpad is an [open source](https://github.com/blindpad/blindpad) collaborative text editor (like Google Docs or [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io)) with integrated semi-anonymizing voice chat intended to help reduce bias in technical communication.  In particular it can be used to extend the concept of “[blind auditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_audition)” to software programming and technical design interviews.  It is inspired by economists Claudia Goldin (Harvard) and Cecilia Rouse (Princeton) who concluded in [their 1997 paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.4.715) that the introduction of blind auditions in professional orchestras is likely responsible for about one-third of the 250% increase in female membership between 1970 and the mid 1990s.
